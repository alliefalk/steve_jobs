    <p class="accomplishments"><b>Some of Steve Jobs' Accomplishments:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>February 24, 1955:</b><br/>
            Steven Paul Jobs is born in San Francisco to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali. The
            then-unmarried couple give up their son to adoption. Paul and Clara Jobs become Jobs' non-biological
            parents.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>1961:</b><br/>The Jobs family moves to Mountain View, Calif., part of what would later become known as
            Silicon Valley.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>1968:</b><br/>Jobs calls Bill Hewlett, the co-founder and co-namesake of Hewlett-Packard, looking for
            spare parts to build a frequency counter. Hewlett gives Jobs the parts, as well as an internship with the
            company that summer..
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>1970:</b><br/>TMeets future Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak through a friend. In Wozniak's 2006
            autobiography, "iWoz," he notes that the two "hit it off" immediately, despite their four-year age
            difference.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>1972:</b><br/>Graduates from Homestead High School in Cupertino, Calif., and enrolls at Reed College in
            Portland, Ore., only to drop out a semester later. Jobs would go on to sit in on classes that interested
            him, such as calligraphy, despite not getting credit for them.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>1974:</b><br/>Begins a brief stint as an engineer at Atari. Working the night shift, he employs Wozniak
            to help whittle down the hardware required for a prototype of a single-player version of Pong, the game that
            would go on to become Breakout. Jobs leaves Atari in the summer to travel through India, only to return to
            California to live in a commune..
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>1976:</b><br/>Co-founds Apple Computer with Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. That same year, the company sells
            the Apple I in the form of a kit that sells for $666.66.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>January 3, 1977:</b><br/>Apple incorporates.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>June 5, 1977:</b><br/>Releases the Apple II, the first commercially available personal computer in a
            plastic case with color graphics--and Apple's first successful personal computer.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>December 12, 1980:</b><br/>Apple goes public, putting Jobs' net worth north of $200 million.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>January 24, 1984:</b><br/>Two days after the $1.5 million Ridley Scott-directed "1984" Super Bowl
            commercial airs, introduces the Macintosh to much fanfare during Apple's shareholder meeting. "For the first
            time ever, I'd like to let Macintosh speak for itself." The computer's voice then says, "Never trust a
            computer you can't lift." Macintosh becomes the first commercially successful small computer with a
            graphical user interface.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>September 12, 1985:</b><br/>CEO John Sculley engineers Jobs' ouster from Apple. Jobs resigns as Apple
            chairman, saying in a board meeting, "I've been thinking a lot, and it's time for me to get on with my life.
            It's obvious that I've got to do something. I'm 30 years old." Soon thereafter, Jobs starts NeXT Computer
            (which later becomes NeXT Software), funded by selling $70 million of his Apple stock. An "interpersonal"
            NeXT workstation, sporting a built-in Ethernet port, is used by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN to become the first
            server of the World Wide Web.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>February 3, 1986:</b><br/>For $10 million, buys the Graphics Group division of Lucasfilm that becomes
            Pixar Animation Studios.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>1988:</b><br/>NeXT Computer releases its first computer.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>1993:</b><br/>NeXT discontinues hardware business, gets into software instead. The company is renamed
            NeXT Software, Inc.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>November 29, 1995:</b><br/>Becomes Pixar's president and CEO. Later in the year, Jobs brings Pixar pubic
            one week after the release of "Toy Story," with Tom Hanks doing the voice of Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz
            Lightyear. The film earns $192 million at the box office. Its success helps make it quite attractive for
            celebrities to lend their voices to animated characters.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>December 10, 1996:</b><br/>Returns to Apple, as an adviser, after it buys NeXT for $429 million.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>July 9, 1997:</b><br/>Becomes CEO, initially as the de facto chief, then as interim chief in September.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>August 6, 1997:</b><br/>Announces a $150 million investment from Microsoft, coupled with a partnership on
            Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for the Mac.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>November 10, 1997:</b><br/>Introduces the Apple Store, which lets consumers custom-order Apple products
            directly from the company online.

        <br/>
        <li><b>January 5, 2000:</b><br/>Drops the "interim" from his CEO title at the Macworld Expo, joking that he
            would be using the title "iCEO," paying homage to the company's product-naming conventions. Takes a $1
            annual salary. Soon terminates projects including Newton and OpenDoc, and changes licensing terms to make
            Mac-cloning cost-prohibitive. Technologies developed at NeXT ultimately evolve into Apple products such as
            the Mac OS.
        </li>
